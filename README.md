during my time with wyncode, the full-stack immersive web-development course that i took, we were assigned multiple projects.  Creating a game was our first official solo project.  The language I used was Ruby, because it was literally the ONLY language I had learned.  I know that the code is wet, and that the repo itself is not organized properly.  But, incorporating Ruby into a bash terminal was an interesting project, and for sentimental reasons, I will probably keep this repository here.  Once i free up some coding time, I would like to come back to it, and DRY it out, and add a few more levels to the game.  SCOOBY DOOBY DOOOOOO.
